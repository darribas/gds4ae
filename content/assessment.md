This module is assessed through a _computational essay_. To complete it
successfully, you will need to demonstrate aptitude in at least three areas:

1. Data audacity
1. Python data skills
1. Machine learning and inference literacy

These translate in the following components of the computational essay:

## 1 - Find, prepare & explore a dataset

Find a dataset you are excited about and that meets the following
characteristics:

- It contains several characteristics (features) for a number of observations
  (samples)
- At least two characteristics are continuous and at least two are
  categorical
- You can think of ways in which clustering the observations based on their
  characteristics could tell an interesting story
- You can imagine a situation in which one of the continuous characteristics can be
  explained in a supervised model as a function of some of the other characteristics

**NOTE**: please discuss with Dani the choice of dataset before the course
finishes

With the dataset at hand:

1. Prepare it for analysis
1. Explore the dataset visually, identifying interesting patterns

## 2 - Unsupervised learning

Perform a clustering exercise & analyse the results. You are expected to try
several clustering models, choose a preferred one, and present a critical argument 
about why that is your choice. To build your argument, you may rely on
graphics, performance scores, and substantive reasoning. Demonstrate that you
understand not only how the mechanics of the algorithms work but that you
are able to translate those into an applied context to make sense of data.

## 3 - Supervised learning

Finally, build a predictive model based on linear regression and:

- Interpret the coefficient
- Evaluate its predictive performance both with and without cross-validation
- Reflect on the differences between assessing the performance of a model
  cross-validating and not.

Similarly to the previous point, demonstrate that you both understand the
workings of the algorithms and techniques but also how you can make the most of it to learn
about your data. Critical thinking is critical.
